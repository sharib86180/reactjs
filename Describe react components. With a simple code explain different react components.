React Components Overview
React components are the modular building blocks of a React application, allowing you to break down the UI into reusable parts. There are two main types of components:

1. Functional Components
What is it? A simple JavaScript function that returns JSX (UI).
Usage: Lightweight, easy to write, often used with React Hooks.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function Greeting() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
2. Class Components
What is it? A more feature-rich component defined as a class.
Usage: Can manage local state and lifecycle methods.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
    }
}
Functional components are preferred in modern React for simplicity, while class components are useful for older patterns and managing complex behaviors.
