State:
What is it? Internal data within a component that can change over time.
Example: A counter that updates when you click a button.
Usage:
javascript
Copy code
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
Props:
What is it? External data passed to a component from its parent.
Example: Setting the initial value of a counter via a prop.
Usage:
javascript
Copy code
function Counter({ initialCount }) {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
}
State is local and mutable; props are external and immutable. Together, they allow for dynamic and interactive components in React.
